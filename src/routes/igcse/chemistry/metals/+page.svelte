  <h1>Metals</h1>
  <h2>Properties</h2>
  <p>Metals are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>solids with high melting and boiling points</li>
    <li>malleable</li>
    <li>good conductors of electricity and heat</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Alloys</h3>
  <p>Alloys are mixtures of a metal with other elements.</p>
  <p>Alloys are used instead of pure metals because they may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>more resistant to corrossion</li>
    <li>stronger</li>
    <li>harder</li>
    <li>less dense</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Alloys contain atoms of <strong>different sizes</strong> which distorts the regular arrangement of atoms in metals. This makes it harder for layers to <strong>slide</strong> over each other.</p>
  <h2>Reactivity Series</h2>
  <p>The reactivity series is a list of metallic elements ranked their reactivity. Elements that are more reactive can <strong>displace</strong> less reactive elements from their compounds, forming a new compound.</p>
  <p>The reactivity series (starting with the most reactive element) is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Group 1
      <ul>
        <li>Potassium</li>
        <li>Sodium</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Group 2
      <ul>
        <li>Calcium</li>
        <li>Magnesium</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Group 3
      <ul>
        <li>Aluminium</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Carbon</li>
    <li>
      Transition Metals
      <ul>
        <li>Zinc</li>
        <li>Iron</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hydrogen</li>
    <li>
      Precious Metals
      <ul>
        <li>Copper</li>
        <li>Silver</li>
        <li>Gold</li>
        <li>Platinum</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Group 1 and 2 <strong>react violently</strong> with water to produce hydrogen gas. Transition metals will not react with water under normal conditions but <strong>will react with steam</strong>. Precious metals are <strong>less reactive than hydrogen</strong> and will not react with water or steam.</p>
  <p>Only elements less reactive than carbon can be extracted from their ores through reduction with carbon.</p>
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ¤”">
    Typically, less reactive metals are more expensive. These metals are often found as pure elements in their ores and not as compounds.
  </Callout>
  <p>Reactivity can be described as the tendency of a metal to form a positive ion.</p>
  <h2>Metal Extraction</h2>
  <p>The extraction of metals from their ores is dependent on the reactivity series.</p>
  <h3>Reduction with Carbon</h3>
  <p>Some metals are extracted using carbon. One such metal is iron.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hematite is loaded into a blast furnace</li>
    <li>Iron is extracted from hematite using carbon monoxide</li>
    <li>Calcium carbonate is used to remove impurities from the ore</li>
    <li>Calcoum carbonate thermally decomposes into calcium oxide which forms slag</li>
    <li>Slag is separately removed from the furnace</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Important reactions take place inside the blast furnace. Coke is used to make carbon monoxide.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    C + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ CO<sub>2</sub>
  </div>
  <div class="equation">
    C + CO<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2CO
  </div>
  <p>Hematite is reduced by carbon monoxide to extract pure iron.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3CO â†’ 2Fe + 3CO<sub>2</sub>
  </div>
  <p>Calcium carbonate used to remove acidic impurities decomposes due to high temperatures.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    CaCO<sub>3</sub> â†’ CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>
  </div>
  <p>Calcium oxide reacts with silica impurities to form slag.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    CaO + SiO<sub>2</sub> â†’ CaSiO<sub>3</sub>
  </div>
  <h3>Electrolysis</h3>
  <p>Metals more reactive than carbon are extracted using electrolysis. For example, aluminium is extracted from bauxite by electrolysis. Aluminium has a <strong>high melting point</strong> that needs to be lowered by mixing it with <strong>cryolite</strong>.</p>
  <h3>Recycling</h3>
  <p>It is important to recycle metals because metal ores are a finite resource.</p>
  <h2>Uses of Metals</h2>
  <h3>Aluminium</h3>
  <p>Aluminium is used in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>aircraft parts because of its strength and low density</li>
    <li>food containers because of its resistance to corrosion</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Aluminium has an apparent unreactivity and resistance to corrision because an oxide layer that adheres to the surface of aluminium. This layer prevents further oxidation.</p>
