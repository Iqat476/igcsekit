  <h2>The Periodic Table</h2>
  <p>The periodic table is used as a method of classifying and predicting the properties of elements.</p>
  <h2>Periodic Trends</h2>
  <p>Elements become more non-metallic across a period. Elements near the bottom left corner of the table are the most metallic while elements near the top right corner are the least metallic.</p>
  <p>An element's group number is equal to the number of electrons in its outer shell (valence electrons). For example, oxygen is in group 6 and has 6 valence electrons.</p>
