  <h2>Magnetism</h2>
  <h3>Magnetic Materials</h3>
  <p>There are 3 types of materials that can be classified by their magnetic properties.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Magnets</strong>: magnetic materials that have a magnetic field with north and south poles
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Magnetic Materials</strong>: elements or alloys of:
      <ul>
        <li>iron</li>
        <li>nickel</li>
        <li>cobalt</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-magnetic Materials</strong>: materials that do not interact with magnets
    </li>
  </ul>
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ¤”">
    Steel is magnetic because it is a alloy containing iron (ferrous alloy).
  </Callout>
  <p>Magnets can only attract and repel some materials.</p>
  <DataTable>

      <Row>
        <Cell>Type</Cell>
        <Cell>Attract</Cell>
        <Cell>Repel</Cell>
      </Row>
    </Head>
    <Body>
      {#each a as row}
        <Row>
          {#each row as cell,i}
            <Cell>
              {#if i}
                <span class="material-symbols-rounded" style="text-align: center; width: 100%;">{cell ? 'check' : 'close'}</span>
              {:else}
                {cell}
              {/if}
            </Cell>
          {/each}
        </Row>
      {/each}
    </Body>
  </DataTable>
  <p>Like poles attract and unlike poles repel. This is only true for magnetised materials because they all have north poles and south poles.</p>
  <h3>Magnetic Field Lines</h3>
  <p>A bar magnet is simply a magnetised rectangular block. Field lines are invisible lines that flow from the north pole to the south pole of the bar magnet.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Magnetic fields always flow from north to south</li>
    <li>
      Arrows on the field lines should point:
      <ul>
        <li>away from the north pole</li>
        <li>into the south pole</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The north arrow on a compass always points in the direction of the field lines</li>
  </ul>
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ¤”">
    Compasses placed at the ends of each pole should point in the same direction.
  </Callout>
  <h3>Magnetic Hardness</h3>
  <p>Any magnetic material can become magnetised using another bar magnet or direct current. However, some materials are easier or harder to magnetise.</p>
  <DataTable>
    <Head>
      <Row>
        <Cell>Material</Cell>
        <Cell>Magnetisation</Cell>
        <Cell>Demagnetisation</Cell>
      </Row>
    </Head>
    <Body>
      {#each b as row}
        <Row>
          {#each row as cell,i}
            <Cell>{cell}</Cell>
          {/each}
        </Row>
      {/each}
    </Body>
  </DataTable>
  <p>Materials with a higher magnetic hardness will take longer to magnetise, but their magnetic field will last longer. A soft iron core is used in transformers because it is easily magnetised and demagnetised.</p>
  <h3>Permanent Magnet</h3>
  <p>A permanent magnet will last longer than an electromagnet. They are made from hard magnetic materials like steel. Common variants of permanent magnets include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>bar</li>
    <li>horseshoe</li>
    <li>refrigerator</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Electromagnet</h3>
  <p>An electromagnet is a temporary magnet made by passing direct current through a coil surrounding a core. Electromagnets use a soft iron core.</p>
  <p>They are often used as switches for closing circuits.</p>
  <h3>Magnetisation</h3>
  <p>There are 3 ways to magnetise a magnetic material such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>stroking in the same direction with a magnet</li>
    <li>passing direct current through a coil</li>
    <li>hammering in a magnetic field</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Electromagnetic Effects</h2>
  <h3>Magnetic Field Patterns</h3>
  <p>The right-hand grip (thumbs-up) rule is used to determine the rotation of a magnetic field produced by a current flowing through a wire.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Thumb points in direction of current</li>
    <li>Fingers curl in direction of magnetic field</li>
  </ul>
